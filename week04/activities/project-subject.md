# W04 Project: Website Subject

The purpose of this assignment is to help you decide on a subject for your website project and to begin its planning and design.

## Submission

Submit your simple text entry. Include the following information:

1. the subject of the website
    A: List of Formula 1 teams, pilots, and cars
2. succinctly describe the planned content of the website
    A: Show the relationships between teams and pilots with the cars they drive that describe some information about the competition for a specific period.
3. the reason you chose this subject
    A: I have being watching for a while the show on Netflex called Formula 1 Drive to Survive, the competition is thought and I like the cars and the colors the teams use. I think this is a nice concept to use the tools that HTML, CSS, and Javascript can offer with images, tables, layouts, and effects.
